# rock-paper-scissors

This is an exercise that involves creating a game of rock paper scissors in the
javascript console.

This exercise is supposed to promote the problem solving thought process and using pseudocode to flesh out the involved algorithms and minimise bugs.

A branch has been added to the project to develop a UI for this game, allowing it to be played outside the console.
